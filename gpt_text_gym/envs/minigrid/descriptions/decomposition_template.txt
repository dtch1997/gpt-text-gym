Rules: 
1. Each objective should follow the template: {verb} the {object}
2. The allowed verbs are: "go to", "pick up", "put down", "open", "close"
3. Objects should be described as: [{color}] {type} [at {coordinate}]
4. Use only the minimum amount of information required to specify an object. For example, if there is only one key in the environment, say 'key'.
5. Disambiguate between objects first by color, then by coordinate. 
6. Do not include coordinates of objects unless absolutely necessary.
